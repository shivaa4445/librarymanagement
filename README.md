**Requirements:-**
Software
Java JDK 11 or higher: To compile and run the Java code.
MySQL Database (or any other relational database): For storing books, users, and transactions.
Apache Tomcat (optional): If you are using Servlets to handle the web interface.
IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans): For writing, compiling, and running Java code.
SQL Client (e.g., MySQL Workbench): To interact with the database.
Libraries & Technologies
Java JDBC: For connecting and interacting with the MySQL database.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For building the front-end user interface.
MySQL: For database management.
Servlets (optional): If implementing dynamic web pages or back-end logic in Java.


**Project Setup**
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository from GitHub (replace the URL with the actual repository URL):
https://github.com/shivaa4445/librarymanagement.git

2. Set Up the MySQL Database
  1.Install MySQL if it is not already installed.

  2.Create the database:
CREATE DATABASE library_db;



**How to Run the Project**
1. Running the Java Backend
Compile and Run the Java Code:

 .Open your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) and import the project.
Ensure the DatabaseConnection.java file is configured with the correct database details.
Run the Main.java class to start the backend application.
javac *.java
java Main

2.Command Line or IDE Usage:

.After compiling the Java code, you can run it directly from the command line or through your IDE's "Run" option.

2. Running the Web Interface (Optional)
 .If you are using HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, you can:

Deploy the Web Interface (Optional):

  .You can deploy the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to a web server like Apache Tomcat (or use a simple local server for testing).
  .  .Place your HTML files in the appropriate folder (e.g., webapps/ROOT in Tomcat).
Open the Web Interface:

Launch the web application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080/ or your configured web server URL.
3. Accessing the Application
  .Frontend: If you have set up a front-end interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the system's main pages (like the homepage, login page, and book management page) can be accessed via the web browser.

  .Backend: The backend logic handles requests from the frontend, interacts with the database, and performs operations like adding books, checking out books, and managing user data.
